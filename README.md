Here's the description about the project:

This project aims to resolve the issue farmers face during irrigation, where water scarcity becomes a challenge, and any wastage of water resources are a 
huge deal.This is mostly caused due to human errors.
This project will try to resolve human errors for water scarcity by automating the irrigation/water pump progress.

Components used:
Resistive Soil Moisture sensor
DHT11 sensor
ESP8266 Node MCU
6.7V Power supply

This System is connected through WiFi using Blynk application, which would display the sensor statistics in real time, to farmers without ever needing to go out into the field.
This saves them time, plus since the function is automated, it would result in a higher crop yield compared to human ways.
